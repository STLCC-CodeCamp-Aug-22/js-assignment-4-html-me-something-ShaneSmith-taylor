     <h3> My first character or main was Bangalore and she was who i played for majority of my first couple seasons. Bangalores passive ability made her extra fast which was a really useful and easy to take use   ability for me. She stayed my main pick until i hit around gold and wanted to play a character with more utility.</h3>

     <h3> Once my team wanted to climb into higher ranks we began to think more about team compisition and characters with abilities that helped the team were more desireable than individual abilities like Bangalores passive. Over the next couple seasons of the game i switched to characters like lifeline and my current main Newcastle but ive played the whole roster.</h3>
